# Log4J Assignment
A simple assignment to practise the Log4J library.

System for generating logs, simulating an external trigger. The logger signals the appender, and the appender(s) send the output to STDOUT or a log file. 
The main purpose of the project is to practise the Log4J library with a time-triggered logging mechansim. However, the configuration file also contains the code for generating different appenders for different logging levels in case the format needs to change with the levels.
